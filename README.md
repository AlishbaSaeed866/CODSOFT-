# CODSOFT-
Here is my repository for the Internship Program 2023 at CodSoft
I undertook the Data Science Tasks:

Task 1: Sales PRediction using Python

  I have used the model of Linear Regression in predicting the impact of advertising on sales  with MSE: 3.8 and R2: 0.87

Task 2: Iris Flower Classification

  I have used the model of Logistic Regression in classifying the three provided species of the Iris flower with an accuracy of about 0.96
  
Task 3: Titanic Survival Prediction 

  For this problem, I have tried three models: KNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes with the respective accuracies of 0.90, 0.99, and 0.99
